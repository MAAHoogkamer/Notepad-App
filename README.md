# Notepad-App
The beginnings of a program thought to act as a Notepad at school. 
In my free time I thought of a function to practice some of the more advanced theory we learned. 
Through data binding I could pass a user defined value from the front end to the back end, 
pass the value to a thread and use it as a parameter in executing the thread which manipulates the background brush colour in the front end code.
